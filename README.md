# Motivation
The original package required `wine-common` which would then conflict with
wine packages from the [winehq.org](https://wiki.winehq.org/Fedora) repository.

# Origin
This is a fork of Fedora's
[winetricks](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/winetricks) package.

# Packages
RPMs can be found
[here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/poettlerric/winetricks/).
